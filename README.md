# Weather App

The Weather App was created to help users find the forecast for a given city.

## Description

The weather app aids users in finding the current and five day forecast for a city of their input. The forecasts include temperature in Fahrenheit, wind speeds in miles per hour, and humidity in a percentage.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- JavaScript
- [OpenWeather API for Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api)
- [OpenWeather API for GeoCoding](https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-api)


## Usage and Website

[Weather App](https://kirstgonz.github.io/weather-app/) will display the current and five day forecast of a city based on a user's input. Cities that users have previous searched for are also available through local storage. If a city that was previously search for is clicked on, the current and five day forecast for that city will appear. This is done through the use of local storage. Furthermore, this app utilizes two separate APIs. The first API is the OpenWeather GeoCoding API. When a user enters the city name, this API converts it into longitude and latitude coordinates that can then be used in the OpenWeather Weather Forecast API.
